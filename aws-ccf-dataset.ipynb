    "\n",
    "[WARC files](https://iipc.github.io/warc-specifications/specifications/warc-format/warc-1.0/) are a container that holds files, similar to zip and tar files. It's the standard data format used by archiving\n",
    "community and we use it to store raw crawl data. As you can see in the file listing above, our WARC files are very large even when compressed! Luckily, we have a much smaller example to look at. \n",
    "\n",
    "Open `whirlwind.warc` in your favorite text editor. Note that this is an uncompressed version of the file; normally we always work with these files while they are compressed. This is the WARC corresponding to the single webpage we mentioned in the introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see four records total, with the start of each record marked with the header `WARC/1.0` followed by metadata related to that particular record. The `WARC-Type` field tells you the type of each record. In our WARC file, we have:\n",
    "1) a `warcinfo` record. Every WARC has that at the start. \n",
    "2) the `request` to the webserver, with its HTTP headers.\n",
    "3) the `response` from the webserver, with its HTTP headers followed by the html.\n",
    "4) a `metadata` record related to the HTTP response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### WET\n",
    "\n",
    "WET (WARC Encapsulated Text) files only contain the body text of web pages parsed from the HTML and exclude any HTML code, images, or other media. This makes them useful for text analysis and natural language processing (NLP) tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open `whirlwind.warc.wet`: this is the WET derived from our original WARC. We can see that it's still in WARC format with two records: \n",
    "1) a `warcinfo` record.\n",
    "2) a `conversion` record: the parsed text with HTTP headers removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### WAT\n",
    "\n",
    "WAT (Web ARChive Timestamp) files contain metadata associated with the crawled web pages (e.g. parsed data from the HTTP response headers, links recovered from HTML pages, server response codes etc.). They are useful for analysis that requires understanding the structure of the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open `whirlwind.warc.wat`: this is the WAT derived from our original WARC. Like the WET file, it's also in WARC format. It contains two records:\n",
    "1) a `warcinfo` record.\n",
    "2) a `metadata` record: there should be one for each response in the WARC. The metadata is stored as JSON. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to feed the JSON into a pretty-printer to read it more easily. For example, you can save just the json into a file and use `python -m json.tool FILENAME` to pretty-print it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've looked at the uncompressed versions of these files to understand their structure, we'll be interacting with compressed WARC, WET, and WAT files for the rest of this tour. This is the usual way we manipulate this data with software tools due to the size of the files.\n"

This can even be used to pinpoint an exact record — for example, `--from 20240518015810 --to 20240518015810` will only ever return the record that we've been looking at elsewhere in this tutorial.\n",

It only downloads the response WARC record because our CDX index only has the response records indexed.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now let's look at the columnar index, the other kind of index that Common Crawl makes available. This index is stored in parquet files so you can access it using SQL-based tools like AWS Athena and duckdb as well as through tables in your favorite table packages such as pandas, pyarrow, and polars.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could read the data directly from our index in our S3 bucket and analyse it in the cloud through AWS Athena. However, this is a managed service that costs money to use (though usually a small amount). You can read about using it here. This whirlwind tour will only use the free method of either fetching data from outside of AWS (which is kind of slow), or making a local copy of a single columnar index (300 gigabytes per monthly crawl), and then using that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The columnar index is divided up into a separate index per crawl, which Athena or duckdb can stitch together. The cdx index is similarly divided up, but cdx_toolkit hides that detail from you.\n",

    "For the purposes of this whirlwind tour, we don't want to configure all the crawl indices because it would be slow. So let's start by figuring out which crawl was ongoing on the date `20240518015810`, and then we'll work with just that one crawl."

    "Index annotations allow users to create a database table that can be joined to Common Crawl's columnar url index or host index. This is useful because we can enrich our datasets with extra information and then use it for analysis. We have a [repository](https://github.com/commoncrawl/cc-index-annotations) with example code for joining annotations to the columnar url index or host index."
